## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A sophisticated shade of burgundy (#800020) evokes a sense of culture and artistry.
- Background color: Off-white (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean and museum-like canvas.
- Accent color: Gold (#D4AF37) for highlighting key elements such as CTAs, prices, and confirmation messages. This choice continues the burgundy palette into metallic tones.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern sans-serif, should convey an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel; for longer text use 'PT Sans'.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif. Together with Playfair, this pairing balances elegance with readability, creating a comfortable yet stylish reading experience.
- Use minimalist icons relevant to museums and exhibits, such as artifacts, maps, and schedules. A thin stroke will match the sans-serif type choices.
- Implement subtle transitions using Framer Motion to provide smooth user interactions and enhance the modern feel.
